                2024, I was tasked to work as the illustrator and designer to bring make the hacker

                Given the task to "create a project with AI that improves daily workflow" our team
                focused on transforming how users interact with Solace PubSub+ documentation. The

                We conducted 7 user interviews with Solace users across different roles (developers,
                students, system architects) to identify pain points and insights for improving
                documentation accessibility. I also researched chatbot implementation in technical

              <p className="text-gray-700 font-libre">
                First, students are busy- they are multitaskers and tend to have heavy schedules. A
                lot of students don’t have the time nor the interest to fill and complete a lengthy
                application. Since our main demographic is engineering and computer science there is
                a scarcity of time for students within these programs.

            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="text-gray-700 font-libre">
                Second, students who apply are typically interested in the creative aspect of
                growing and discovering within the tech space, They want to collaborate, and have
                the end-goal of creating by participating in the event.

              <p className="text-gray-700 font-libre">
                Finally, students are interested in engaging. This application was designed with the
                idea of branching out of the typical resume format. Students apply to tens to
                hundreds of various applications. Thus, allowing people to remain engaged and
                bringing a sense of interest to the student’s workday was vital.

              allows them to save all their information/work, allowing them to move forward to be
              able to store general and personal data. This is a vital part of the application since

              The most vital part of the application lies in the long answer portion. We created it

              the majority of their time in this portion. The user can see the word count and the

              After countless nights alone designing, studying student interests, and diving into

              feedback I got made all those solitary hours of scrutiny worth it. Oftentimes I get so
              sucked into the details of my work that I forget the impact it can have on the people
